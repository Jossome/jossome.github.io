<p>As for non-research part of me, I'm a <a href="https://huel.mention-me.com/m/ol/ln9rh-6def622508">Huel</a> drinker, and I personally believe that our gustatory system has become useless and human will discard it through evolution. However, I'm a food lover for two reasons - a) I still have the sense of taste because evolution takes time; b) Foods are tasty. My top three choices: Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</p>
