<h2>About</h2>
<p>Second-year PhD in CSE department at Washington University in St. Louis. My advisor is Dr. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik.</p>
<p>I publish under the name Shaojie Wang. Joss is a preferred name to be called by if one cannot pronounce Shaojie correctly. The reason is, all inaccurate pronunciations that I've heard of so far have very inappropriate meanings in my mother tongue.</p>
