<h2>About</h2>
<p>Second-year PhD in CSE department at Washington University in St. Louis. My advisor is Dr. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik. I'm interested in adversarial machine learning and computer vision. I publish under the name Shaojie Wang.</p>

<p>As for non-research part of me, I'm a <a href="https://huel.mention-me.com/m/ol/ln9rh-6def622508">Huel</a> drinker, and I personally believe that our gustatory system has become useless and human will discard it through evolution. However, I'm a food lover for two reasons - a) I still have the sense of taste because evolution takes time; b) I'm very bad at dopamine management. Delicious food boosts my dopamine level, which makes me unable to resist them. My top three choices: Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</p>
